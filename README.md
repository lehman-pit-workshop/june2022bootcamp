# june2022bootcamp

In this repository we will work on:

- getting totally comfortable with R.
- practice reproducible research.
- cleaning data.
- understanding ordinary least squares regression.

Of course we will also be using github.

You will want to fork this repository.
Then create a new project "from version control" in R studio, checking out the code from your repository. 

[] Install the tidyverse and the palmerpenguins data set. Also if you don't have Rmarkdown, knitr, and usethis installed, install those.
[] If you have not done so, you will need to create a PAT (personal access token) for github. You can follow the instructions here: https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html
